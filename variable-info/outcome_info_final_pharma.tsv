A serving of vegetables would be the typical amount dished up as an accompaniment to main meal. e.g. if you had a roast dinner with meat, potatoes, carrots and peas, most people would have one serving of potatoes, one serving of carrots and one serving of peas. For small amounts of vegetables that are not big enough to be counted individually (e.g. in a stew), please guess the number of servings and record that under Vegetable pieces. A serving is about the amount that would be dished up using a serving spoon (large spoon typically used in canteens or self-service buffets). Example: a beef stew with carrot and parsnip may have enough vegetables in it to count as a half serving of carrots plus a half serving of parsnip (possibly even a whole serving if there are a lot of vegetables in the stew). If not, it may be better to record the vegetables as a half serving of Vegetable pieces. For a selection of vegetables where the precise type may be unknown (for example in a shop bought vegetable pie or a stir fry cooked by a friend) please guess the total amount and record that under Vegetable pieces. Olives should have been recorded earlier under 'Savoury Snacks'. If your vegetable is not on the list, please record it under 'Other' located at the bottom of the list.

To help account for variations in position in different scanned participants, several variables have been generated which describe aspects of the positioning and can be used as """"""""confounding variables"""""""" - for example they might be regressed out of brain phenotypes before carrying out correlations between these and non-imaging variables.   The table position is the Z-co-ordinate of the coil (and the scanner table that the coil sits on) within the scanner. The Z axis points down the centre of the magnet."	http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=2575925761						UK Biobank Assessment Centre > Imaging > Brain MRI > Task functional brain MRI	106	90th percentile of BOLD effect (in group-defined mask) for shapes activation	18663	18663	Accruing	Continuous	percent	Data	Derived	Unisex	1	1		90th percentile of the BOLD (blood-oxygen-level dependent) effect (in group-defined mask) for shapes activation (in task fMRI data)	http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=2576125762						UK Biobank Assessment Centre > Imaging > Brain MRI > Task functional brain MRI	106	90th percentile of z-statistic (in group-defined mask) for shapes activation	18663	18663	Accruing	Continuous	Z	Data	Derived	Unisex	1	1		90th percentile of the z-statistic (in group-defined mask) for shapes activation (in task fMRI data)	http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=2576225763						UK Biobank Assessment Centre > Imaging > Brain MRI > Task functional brain MRI	106	90th percentile of BOLD effect (in group-defined mask) for faces activation	18663	18663	Accruing	Continuous	percent	Data	Derived	Unisex	1	1		90th percentile of the BOLD (blood-oxygen-level dependent) effect (in group-defined mask) for faces activation (in task fMRI data)	http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=2576325764						UK Biobank Assessment Centre > Imaging > Brain MRI > Task functional brain MRI	106	90th percentile of z-statistic (in group-defined mask) for faces activation	18663	18663	Accruing	Continuous	Z	Data	Derived	Unisex	1	1		90th percentile of the z-statistic (in group-defined mask) for faces activation (in task fMRI data)	http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=2576425765						UK Biobank Assessment Centre > Imaging > Brain MRI > Task functional brain MRI	106	90th percentile of BOLD effect (in group-defined mask) for faces-shapes contrast	18663	18663	Accruing	Continuous	percent	Data	Derived	Unisex	1	1		90th percentile of the BOLD (blood-oxygen-level dependent) effect (in group-defined mask) for faces-shapes contrast (in task fMRI data)	http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=2576525766						UK Biobank Assessment Centre > Imaging > Brain MRI > Task functional brain MRI	106	90th percentile of z-statistic (in group-defined mask) for faces-shapes contrast	18663	18663	Accruing	Continuous	Z	Data	Derived	Unisex	1	1		90th percentile of the z-statistic (in group-defined mask) for faces-shapes contrast (in task fMRI data)	http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=2576625767						UK Biobank Assessment Centre > Imaging > Brain MRI > Task functional brain MRI	106	90th percentile of BOLD effect (in group-defined amygdala activation mask) for faces-shapes contrast	18663	18663	Accruing	Continuous	percent	Data	Derived	Unisex	1	1		90th percentile of the BOLD (blood-oxygen-level dependent) effect (in group-defined amygdala activation mask) for faces-shapes contrast (in task fMRI data)	http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=2576725768						UK Biobank Assessment Centre > Imaging > Brain MRI > Task functional brain MRI	106	90th percentile of z-statistic (in group-defined amygdala activation mask) for faces-shapes contrast	18663	18663	Accruing	Continuous	Z	Data	Derived	Unisex	1	1		90th percentile of the z-statistic (in group-defined amygdala activation mask) for faces-shapes contrast (in task fMRI data)	http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=2576825780					778	UK Biobank Assessment Centre > Imaging > Brain MRI	100	Acquisition protocol phase.	4522	4522	Accruing	Categorical single		Data	Supporting	Unisex	1	1	778	"The acquisition protocol Phase number.
